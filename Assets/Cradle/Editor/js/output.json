As I step onto the campus and you see a small sign in front of the a large building. A sense of excitement and anticipation fills me as I read:\n\nHello $name! We will be providing you a more formal welcome with an information packet and map as you proceed to the administrative building. This building was originally constructed in 1889 and referred to as the Main building but wwas recently renamed Holladay Hall\n\nI smile at the memory and the long summers spent in fake wars that always ended in elaborate and dramatic death scenes. Now we both were here, sharing a dorm room and forging our paths that we decided so early during those hot summer days. \n\nI need to [[find him soon]], as we will be sharing a room this semester.\n\n<<set $health to 60>>",

Lights hanging above wood parquet flooring illuminate the grand hallway. The walls are papered with notices and posters outlining progress of student organizations, graduating classes, and perhaps most importantly, the war effort.  Several catch my eye:\n\n[[Victory Gardens!]]  Support the War Effort!\n[[Battle the Flu]] Kaiser Bill's ally\n[[Agricultural Extension]] notices\n\nI sigh and wonder when this dreadful war will be over. America’s involvement had begun only recently, but it resulted in the fantasies of my youth coming true, at least in part, for good and ill. We, Alex and I will both be soldiers in training, cadets, along with most of the other students on campus.  I am still not thrilled at the propspect, but I understand the need.  Pacisfism didn't work to stop the German machine.  Maybe innovation can.\n \n You turn down a [[long hallway]]\n",

Hey Mister!!\"\n<img src=\"https://iiif.lib.ncsu.edu/iiif/0004941/square/300,/0/default.jpg\" />\nI enter a large green courtyard with flowers and grass surrounding a central plaza.  It sits in the center of the few original building on campus.  I see a small girl of about 8 years old playing with jacks in tiled area.  She is waving at me and jumping excitedly.\n\n\"Mister! Hello mister!  My name is Mary.  May Yarborough.  I will go to college one day and be a famous person!  Maybe a scientist! Hey mister, do you want to play jacks?\"\n\n[[Yes|play jacks]]\n\n[[No]]",

There are so many differing opinions on what Alex may have wrong, not to mention the pros and cons of vaccines.  Some say they save lives and will extend human life.  Others claim they are deadly, far more trouble than they are worth. If it is Spanish Flu that was affecting Alex, it is extremely dangerous.  The flu is deadly in some cases, known for drastic and rapid changes in health and stability.  \n\nAlex's syptoms match the flu: dizziness, fever, sweats and exhaustion.\n\nOne thing that occurs everywhere in the literature is that best to assist any treatments with proper nutrition.  I decide my next stop hsould be the kitchens in [[Leazar Hall]].  Perhaps I can make some restortive broth.\n\n\n",

One steps forward with a smile and and air of care and concern.  \n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4SR3Kum.png\" />\n\n\"How can I help, sir?\"\n\nIt is Ella Mc Guire, making up some broth for her patients.  She is a legend among the students, calm and caring.  She acts like a mother to many of the men here so homesick for a mother's concern.\nI've chatted with her before. She told me she was a freed slave who worked most of her young life on a plantations, but came to Raleigh when she was freed.  She is shocked at the Spanish Flu and has been helping as she could with nursing and care.\n\n<<if $profession is \"Farmer\">> \nI ask her about folk remedies she knows and she describes some recipes for tea that have willow bark for pain and fever.  I ask if she knows about the herbs and she directs me to the [[Victory Garden]] and I will find what I need.\n\n\n<<else>> I ask Ms. McGuire for some special broth that I can take to Alex.  It is important he regain some strength and his natural resistance before he can enter any trial.\n\nShe is kind as she prepares the broth for me to take over.  She offers to put some herbs or other natural remdies, but I refuse. \n\"Thank you, but no.  If he does enter the trial, I wouldn't want to interfere with that.\"\nI leave the kitchens and head to the [[infirmary|Winslow Hall 2]] \n\n<<endif>>",
